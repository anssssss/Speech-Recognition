Vietnamese Speech Recognition using Connectionist Temporal Classification

Data source: AILAB (https://ailab.hcmus.edu.vn/vivos/)

Based on Neural network architecture from Deep Speech: Scaling up end-to-end speech recognition by Hannun et al. 
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.5567.pdf)

Implementation of CTC is based on example by Keras (https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/image_ocr.py#L457)
